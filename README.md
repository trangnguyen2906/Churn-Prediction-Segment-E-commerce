## 📌 Background & Overview  

### 🧩 Project Context:
A e-commerce company is facing a business challenge: user churn. Many customers stop interacting with the platform after a short period, resulting in lost revenue and reduced customer lifetime value. However, the company currently lacks a systematic, data-driven approach to understand: 

- Why users churn
- How to predict churn in advance
- How to re-engage churned users effectively

### Objective:

### 📖 What is this project about? What Business Question will it solve?

This project uses **Machine Learning** to help an e-commerce company proactively tackle customer churn and design better promotion strategies. 

It focuses on answering three key business questions:

- 📊 What are the **patterns and behaviors of churned users?**
→ Understand why users churn and suggest actionable retention strategies

- 🔍 Which **users** are **likely to churn**?
→ Build and fine-tune supervised ML models to predict churn risk

- 🧩 How can we **group churned users** for targeted promotions? 
→ Apply unsupervised ML (clustering) to segment churned users by behavior and value 
 
🎯 The goal is to support data-driven decision-making in **user retention, promotion targeting, and customer lifecycle management.**


### 👤 Who is this project for?  
- **Marketing Teams** – to target churned users with personalized campaigns
- **Data Analysts** – to uncover churn patterns and build models
- **Decision Makers** – to guide strategy and resource allocation
